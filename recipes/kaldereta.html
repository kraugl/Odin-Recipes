    <h1>Beef Kaldereta Recipe</h1>
    <img src="kaldereta.jpg">
    <h4>Beef Kaldereta (Caldereta) is a popular Filipino stew that is served during parties and holidays.</h4>
    <p>There are so many great Filipino stews and a couple of my favorites that I’ve shared before include chicken afritada and pinakbet. Traditionally, kaldereta is made using goat meat. However, goat is not always easily accessible, so beef, chicken or pork may be used instead. Tomato sauce, onion, liver spread, bell pepper and cheese are usually part of the recipe as well.  The purpose of the liver spread is to thicken and add flavor the sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ lbs stewing beef cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
