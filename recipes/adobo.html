    <h4>Adobo is considered as Philippines' national dish.</h4>
    <p>Chicken Adobo is a Filipino dish made by braising chicken legs (thighs and/or drumsticks) in a sauce made up of vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and black pepper. It’s tangy, salty, garlicy, slightly sweet, and spicy. The chicken is slowly simmered in the sauce making it flavorful and incredibly tender.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cane vinegar</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp. whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>6 bone in chicken thighs </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, black peppercorns, and bay leaves in a large, nonreactive sauté pan, and then nestle the chicken thighs, skin side down, into the pan. Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, and then cover and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Turn the chicken over, and then cover and simmer for another 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover the pan, and then increase the heat to high and return the sauce to a boil. While occasionally turning and basting the chicken, continue boiling the sauce, uncovered, until it is reduced by half and thickens slightly, 5–7 minutes. Serve with steamed white rice.</li>
